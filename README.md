# GNSS-Application

This project is my first graduation project(Software) with my partner Ola Awwad.

GNSS stands for Global Navigation Satellite System, which includes all global satellite positioning systems. This project presents an android mobile application that gives surveyors an opportunity to facilitate their work in surveying lands, positioning, calculating areas and distances easily, and to rid of the trouble of manual calculations conveniently.
Our application corrects data, called NMEA messages that contains inaccurate positions, received from a GPS device through a Bluetooth connection. NMEA messages are passed through analysis process in our application to obtain useful and accurate information. Then, the information is used to calculate accurate positions, the area of a closed shape of points, the distance between two points and the azimuth (an angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system). It is also used to show data and calculations on an interactive map, draw active satellites and show their type and strength. Finally, our application is verified and approved by a surveyor in real life.
